# Shopping Site Theme

A clean, responsive theme for an e-commerce / shopping website. This README is an English, copy-paste-ready file you can drop into the repository.

## Key features
- Modern, minimal design
- Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Product listing and detail templates
- Easily customizable CSS/SCSS variables
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into static sites or frontend frameworks

## Files & suggested structure
- index.html / home.html — Main landing page  
- product.html — Product detail page  
- /css — Styles (CSS or SCSS)  
- /js — JavaScript (optional behavior)  
- /images or /assets/img — Theme images and screenshots (if used)  
- README.md — This file

Adjust the structure to match your repository if files are named differently.

## Installation & local preview
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/sakipfikrret/shopping_site_theme.git
2. Open the main HTML file (e.g., index.html) in a browser to preview.
3. If the project uses a build system (npm, webpack, gulp):
   - npm install
   - npm run build
   - npm start (or follow the project-specific instructions)

## How to add or update screenshots (if you decide to include them later)
1. Place images in a folder like `images/` or `assets/img/`.
2. Reference them with relative paths in this README:
   - Example: `![Home preview](assets/img/home.png)`
3. Commit and push the changes.

## Customization tips
- Colors: Change CSS variables or SCSS maps to customize the palette.  
- Typography: Replace or extend web fonts (Google Fonts recommended).  
- Product cards: Modify the grid or card components in HTML/CSS for different layouts.  
- Performance: Compress images (webp or optimized PNG/JPEG) and lazy-load product images.
